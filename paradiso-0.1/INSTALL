    Paradiso DRM
    ---------------
    
    This package contains all the files needed to build:
        
    - the commandline utility
    - a paradiso DRM provider
    - a paradiso DRM customer/reseller
    
    Building
    ---------------
    The dependencies of the Makefile are broken at this moment,
    so in order to recompile the code after you made some changes
    please always type 'make clean' before building the program.
    
    Build the customer/reseller version of the program as follows:
        
        make clean
        make paradiso
        
    You can build the provider version with:
        
        make clean
        make PROVIDER=1 paradiso
        
    Create the commandline with the following method:
        
        make clean
        make commandline
        
    You can also build the commandline and paradiso program at once:
        
        make clean
        make all
        
    Installing
    ---------------
    In order to start using the Paradiso DRM some keys and signatures
    should be created. The directory needed by Paradiso DRM should also
    be created. Issue the following command to create a directory called
    data containing all the neccessary files:
        
        make install
        
    Uninstalling is also possible and is accomplished with:
        
        make uninstall
