DRM Paradiso is a unique Digitial Rights Management (DRM) system 
which allows customers who buy music (or other digital content) 
from an online distribution store to also buy rights to resell 
the song to his friends in a controlled manner!

Research related to this was carried out as part of Ph.D. work of
Srijith Nair (https://srijith.net) at Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam.

The source code included here was used to implement a working
prototype of the DRM scheme on a Neuros OSD Board.
