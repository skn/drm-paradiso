Release 0.1: (14th Nov. 2006)
This is a alpha quality code that has been released to kick-start the project. We have used it with success on the beta version of the Neuros OSD Board. Your mileage may vary! We modified the Ralink RT25USB-SRC-V2.0.7.0 USB driver to support wireless on the board. The modified source code is being made available here under the original license of the code (GPL). More details on the porting is available in this Neuros Wiki post.
